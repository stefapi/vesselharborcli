long-description="""VesselHarbor is a free, self-hostable Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) designed to turn any Raspberry Pi or VPS into a fully featured personal cloud. It simplifies the deployment and management of virtual machines, Docker Swarm stacks, websites, DNS records, and email servicesâ€”all from a unified interface.
With one command to install and a CLI or web UI to operate, VesselHarbor makes it easy to self-host popular applications like Nextcloud, WordPress, Git platforms, and more, without needing deep DevOps expertise.
Whether you want to manage your own infrastructure, reclaim digital sovereignty, or just explore self-hosting, VesselHarbor provides the tools to do it reliably, securely, and efficiently."""
